Projects involving loans to microfinance institutions are screened as Category C projects under OPIC’s environmental and social guidelines.  Environmental, health, safety and social impact concerns are minimal.  However, in order to insure that the Portfolio Company’s loans are consistent with OPIC’s statutory and policy requirements the loan will be subject to conditions regarding use of proceeds.

There is no U.S. procurement associated with this Project, and, therefore the Project is expected to have a neutral impact on U.S. employment.  The Project is expected to have a positive five-year U.S. balance of payments impact.","This Project is expected to have a highly developmental impact in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines by providing growth capital to support microfinance lending, primarily to rural and women borrowers.  The Fund will make an equity investment in a Portfolio Company that will on-lend the proceeds to three microfinance institutions. According to the World Bank, over half of the world’s unbanked population resides in Asia. This investment will support the host governments’ efforts to increase financial inclusion to poor, rural individuals that are currently underserved by traditional banking institutions.  This Project is expected to result in significant job creation, tax payments to the host governments, and training by the Portfolio Company to micro-borrowers in financial literacy.  In India, where the Portfolio Company will have its largest investment, the microfinance institution is evaluating a pilot program for paperless loan approvals that utilize technologies like cell phones.  The Portfolio Company is also working with this microfinance institution to evaluate a possible small banking license application following the Reserve Bank of India’s September 2015 announcement to license up to 10 financial institutions to establish small banks that will be able to provide microfinance loans in India.",EC-04074,CreditAccess Asia N.V.,Clearance Completed,2016-02-01,2/1/2016,C-Cleared,,70,0,Not Scored,0.1.4,,,0,0,,0,,0,,,,,9000031688,0,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sub-IC,0,Low,,India,"Indonesia, Philippines, India",Asia,0,0,1,0,,,386,,1,,0,0,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,

Projects involving the installation of roof-top communication towers on commercial property and operation of existing communication towers are screened as Category B projects under OPIC’s environmental and social guidelines because impacts are site specific and readily mitigated.  The primary environmental and social concerns related to this Project are associated with the safety of employees and contractors involved in the installation of roof-top communication equipment.  Applicable Standards: OPIC’s environmental and social due diligence indicates that the Project will have impacts that must be managed in a manner consistent with the following International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) 2012 Performance Standards (PS):-PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts;-PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions;-PS 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention; and-PS 4: Community Health, Safety and Security.The Project will not involve any physical or economic displacement and no land will be purchased for the Project.  All construction activities will be undertaken on commercial property and the Borrower will reach a lease agreement with the local landlords through negotiations of commercial terms.  Therefore, IFC’s Performance Standard 5 is not triggered by the Project at this time.  The Project will install roof-top communication equipment on commercial properties located in rural areas which the Borrower has represented will be in permitted locations. At a few national parks, small-sized non-intrusive wireless communication equipment (antenna) will be installed in order to meet the communication needs of the park authorities. The roof-top communication equipment will be installed in a manner which is consistent with the visual landscape and the management of the relevant parks.  In addition, the Project sites are not expected to adversely impact any critical habitat or cultural heritage.  Therefore, PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and PS 8: Cultural Heritage are not triggered at this time.  No Indigenous Peoples will be adversely impacted at any of the Project sites.  Thus, PS7: Indigenous Peoples is also not triggered at this time.In accordance with PS 3, IFC’s Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) General Guidelines (2007) and EHS Guidelines for Telecommunications will be applicable to this Project.The Project is not expected to have significant greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions as it plans to use solar panels for charging its wireless communication equipment and achieve carbon neutral status.Environmental and Social Risks and Mitigation: The Borrower will manage both the construction of new roof-top communication equipment and their operation in accordance with its policies which also ensure compliance with both the local regulations and IFC Performance Standards and Guidelines. The Borrower has adopted detailed procedures relating to worker and contractor safety.  In addition, employees and contractors will also receive extensive training specific to their jobs.  All solid wastes will be transported off site and disposed at permitted facilities by licensed contractors.  The Project does not generate significant quantities of wastewaters.  Dust and other air emissions will be controlled to acceptable levels.   The Borrower will be required to continue implementing its overarching environmental and sustainability policies that will be used to guide the Project’s environmental and social performance.  The Borrower will also be required to continue implementing its grievance mechanism.  In addition, the Borrower will also be required to ensure compliance with IFC’s Performance Standards (2012) and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines for Telecommunications and General EHS Guidelines (2007).","Aggarwal, Sanjeev",EN-00145,0,B,5/10/2016,C-Cleared,2016-05-10,Clearance Completed,a21t000000HGgqJ,9000031411 Form_008_Submission_Adjustment 2021,,,"The Project is not expected to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy or employment.  There is no U.S. procurement associated with this project, and, therefore the project is expected to have a neutral impact on U.S. employment.  The project is expected to have a negative five-year U.S. balance of payments impact.","This Project is expected to have a highly developmental impact in Kenya, a low income country, by providing affordable, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots to consumers in rural areas. The Project will also provide free device charging to its clients in a country where in 2012, only 6.7 percent of its rural population had access to electricity. The Project will utilize new technology and a new business model to reach areas currently underserved by broadband service providers. The Project is also expected to create new professional and technical job opportunities in Kenya.

Projects involving the installation of roof-top communication towers on commercial property and operation of existing communication towers are screened as Category B projects under OPIC’s environmental and social guidelines because impacts are site specific and readily mitigated.  The primary environmental and social concerns related to this Project are associated with the safety of employees and contractors involved in the installation of roof-top communication equipment.  Applicable Standards: OPIC’s environmental and social due diligence indicates that the Project will have impacts that must be managed in a manner consistent with the following International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) 2012 Performance Standards (PS):-PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts;-PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions;-PS 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention; and-PS 4: Community Health, Safety and Security.The Project will not involve any physical or economic displacement and no land will be purchased for the Project.  All construction activities will be undertaken on commercial property and the Borrower will reach a lease agreement with the local landlords through negotiations of commercial terms.  Therefore, IFC’s Performance Standard 5 is not triggered by the Project at this time.  The Project will install roof-top communication equipment on commercial properties located in rural areas which the Borrower has represented will be in permitted locations. At a few national parks, small-sized non-intrusive wireless communication equipment (antenna) will be installed in order to meet the communication needs of the park authorities. The roof-top communication equipment will be installed in a manner which is consistent with the visual landscape and the management of the relevant parks.  In addition, the Project sites are not expected to adversely impact any critical habitat or cultural heritage.  Therefore, PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and PS 8: Cultural Heritage are not triggered at this time.  No Indigenous Peoples will be adversely impacted at any of the Project sites.  Thus, PS7: Indigenous Peoples is also not triggered at this time.In accordance with PS 3, IFC’s Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) General Guidelines (2007) and EHS Guidelines for Telecommunications will be applicable to this Project.The Project is not expected to have significant greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions as it plans to use solar panels for charging its wireless communication equipment and achieve carbon neutral status.Environmental and Social Risks and Mitigation: The Borrower will manage both the construction of new roof-top communication equipment and their operation in accordance with its policies which also ensure compliance with both the local regulations and IFC Performance Standards and Guidelines. The Borrower has adopted detailed procedures relating to worker and contractor safety.  In addition, employees and contractors will also receive extensive training specific to their jobs.  All solid wastes will be transported off site and disposed at permitted facilities by licensed contractors.  The Project does not generate significant quantities of wastewaters.  Dust and other air emissions will be controlled to acceptable levels.   The Borrower will be required to continue implementing its overarching environmental and sustainability policies that will be used to guide the Project’s environmental and social performance.  The Borrower will also be required to continue implementing its grievance mechanism.  In addition, the Borrower will also be required to ensure compliance with IFC’s Performance Standards (2012) and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines for Telecommunications and General EHS Guidelines (2007).","Aggarwal, Sanjeev",EN-00145,0,B,5/10/2016,C-Cleared,2016-05-10,Clearance Completed,a21t000000HGgqJ,9000031411 Form_008_Submission_Adjustment 2021,,,"The Project is not expected to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy or employment.  There is no U.S. procurement associated with this project, and, therefore the project is expected to have a neutral impact on U.S. employment.  The project is expected to have a negative five-year U.S. balance of payments impact.","This Project is expected to have a highly developmental impact in Kenya, a low income country, by providing affordable, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots to consumers in rural areas. The Project will also provide free device charging to its clients in a country where in 2012, only 6.7 percent of its rural population had access to electricity. The Project will utilize new technology and a new business model to reach areas currently underserved by broadband service providers. The Project is also expected to create new professional and technical job opportunities in Kenya.

MSMEs are an important driver in the Cambodian economy, accounting for at least 40-50% of total employment.   However, MSME growth is constrained by limited access to finance.  Only 7.9% of Cambodian firms use banks to finance investments and only 3.6% use banks to finance working capital.   Loans originated by ACLEDA Bank will be used for start-up, working, and expansion capital purposes.  ACLEDA Bank is expected to hire over four hundred permanent employees to work on MSME lending as a result of the OPIC-supported investment.  ACLEDA will also provide technical assistance to industry counterparts by providing training for government workers, banks, MFIs, NGOs, private companies, and Cambodian students at its regional training centers.  Additionally, this Project aligns with host government development initiatives because expanding microfinance services and credit to SMEs is an important component of the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III (RSIII), which reaffirms the Government’s mission to sustainable development and poverty reduction.",EC-04052,a1It0000006XIMS,Clearance Completed,2016-01-29,1/29/2016,C-Cleared,,70,0,Not Scored,0.1.4,,,0,0,1/26/2017,0,,1,,,,,9000031561,0,0,Approved,2/2/2016,,,,0,3/17/2016,,Approved,1/11/2016,,,,,3/17/2016,,,,Board,0,Low,,Cambodia,Cambodia,Asia,0,0,1,1,,,442,,1,,0,1,,0,1,Microvest,,SF,,001t0000007i9fw,,,USA,,A-031164

The IFC estimates that as many as 70% of women-owned SMEs in the formal sector in developing countries are unserved or underserved by financial institutions – a financing gap of around $285 billion—but if this credit gap is closed by 2020, per capita incomes could be 12% higher by 2030.   Loans originated by ACLEDA Bank will be used for start-up, working, and expansion capital as well as equipment purchasing.  Additionally, the WEOF Loan will catalyze funding from GSF for technical assistance and incentives for lending to women-owned enterprises.",EC-04083,,Clearance Completed,2016-02-11,2/11/2016,C-Cleared,,75,0,Not Scored,0.1.4,,,0,0,1/3/2018,0,,1,,,,,9000031773,0,0,Approved,2/11/2016,,,,0,3/17/2016,,Approved,2/9/2016,,1/21/2016,,,3/17/2016,,,,IC,0,Low,,Cambodia,Cambodia,Asia,0,0,1,1,,,442,,1,,0,1,"Updated reporting count February 2023, reporting under another project.

Projects involving loans to financial institutions for the purposes of MSME on-lending are screened as Category C projects under OPIC’s environmental and social guidelines. The environmental, health, safety and social impacts from the Project are considered minimal. However, in order to ensure that the Project is consistent with OPIC’s statutory and policy requirements, the OPIC-guaranteed loans made by the Borrower will be subject to conditions regarding the use of proceeds, and the Borrower will be required to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees. The Project’s activities, which involve providing loans to MSMEs, are not vulnerable to climate change and therefore a climate change resilience assessment is not needed.  Acleda has an Environmental and Social Management System to screen and assess potential environmental and social risks of projects it supports but does not have a formalized community grievance mechanism. The Project will be required to develop a formalized community grievance mechanism for OPIC’s review and approval.","Kim, Jean",EN-00284,0,C,2/1/2016,C-Cleared,2016-02-01,Clearance Completed,a21t000000HGh41,9000031561 Form_008_Submission_Adjustment 2021,,,"The Project is not expected to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy or employment.  There is no U.S. procurement associated with this Project, and, therefore the Project is expected to have a neutral impact on U.S. employment.  The Project is expected to have a negative five-year U.S. balance of payments impact.","This Project is expected to have a highly developmental impact in Cambodia by expanding ACLEDA Bank’s lending to micro, small and medium sized businesses, about half of which are expected to be women-owned.  MSMEs are an important driver in the Cambodian economy, accounting for at least 40-50% of total employment.   However, MSME growth is constrained by limited access to finance.  Only 7.9% of Cambodian firms use banks to finance investments and only 3.6% use banks to finance working capital.   Loans originated by ACLEDA Bank will be used for start-up, working, and expansion capital purposes.  ACLEDA Bank is expected to hire over four hundred permanent employees to work on MSME lending as a result of the OPIC-supported investment.  ACLEDA will also provide technical assistance to industry counterparts by providing training for government workers, banks, MFIs, NGOs, private companies, and Cambodian students at its regional training centers.  Additionally, this Project aligns with host government development initiatives because expanding microfinance services and credit to SMEs is an important component of the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III (RSIII), which reaffirms the Government’s mission to sustainable development and poverty reduction.",EC-04052,a1It0000006XIMS,Clearance Completed,2016-01-29,1/29/2016,C-Cleared,,70,0,Not Scored,0.1.4,,,0,0,1/26/2017,0,,1,,,,,9000031561,0,0,Approved,2/2/2016,,,,0,3/17/2016,,Approved,1/11/2016,,,,,3/17/2016,,,,Board,0,Low,,Cambodia,Cambodia,Asia,0,0,1,1,,,442,,1,,0,1,,0,1,Microvest,,SF,,001t0000007i9fw,,,USA,,A-031164
